# HOW TO

I'd be happy to guide you through the process of building your TSX page and displaying it locally. This process involves setting up a Next.js project, creating your TSX file, and running the development server. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Set up your development environment:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)



2. Create a new Next.js project:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project
3. Run the following command:

```plaintext
npx create-next-app@latest my-personal-website
```


4. Answer the prompts. For a typical setup, you can say yes to most options, including TypeScript and Tailwind CSS support.



3. Navigate into your project directory:

```plaintext
cd my-personal-website
```


4. Create or modify your TSX file:

1. If you're using the App Router (which is the default for new Next.js projects), your main page will be in `app/page.tsx`
2. Replace the contents of this file with your personal webpage code. Here's a basic example:





```typescriptreact project="Personal Webpage" file="app/page.tsx"
...
```

5. Run the development server:

1. In your terminal, make sure you're in the project directory
2. Run the following command:

```plaintext
npm run dev
```





6. View your website:

1. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see your personal webpage displayed



7. Make changes:

1. As you edit your TSX file, the changes will automatically be reflected in the browser (thanks to Next.js's hot reloading feature)





Additional tips:

- If you encounter any errors, check the terminal where you ran `npm run dev` for error messages
- Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed. If you're using components from libraries like `@radix-ui/react-icons` or `@/components/ui`, you may need to install these packages or create these components
- If you're using custom styles or Tailwind CSS configurations, ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` and `globals.css` files are set up correctly


Remember, this is a development server. When you're ready to deploy your website, you'll need to build it for production using `npm run build` and then deploy it to a hosting service.
